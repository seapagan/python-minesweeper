# Python Minesweeper

A Python implementation of the classic
[Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) game.

This code from a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) video. **At this
time it is unmodified**, however I intend to take it further. Plans include (but
are not limited to):

- custom grid size
- scalable and cleaner layout
- sound
- more encapsulation (game should be an object not just the Cells.)
- use graphical icons for mine, flag etc.
- hiscore and history
